# Federated Learning Platform – Prerequisite Knowledge Guide

Welcome!  This README walks you through the background topics you should feel comfortable with **before** you start building the *Privacy‑Preserving Federated Learning Platform*.  Each section explains **why** the knowledge matters to the project and points you to high‑quality resources so you can level‑up fast.

---

## 1. Machine‑Learning Fundamentals

**Why it matters**  The core of federated learning is still vanilla supervised ML: you train, validate, and test a model; you worry about bias, variance, and generalisation. If these basics are shaky, debugging FL will be impossible.

**Topics to cover**

* Train/validation/test splits, cross‑validation
* Loss functions & optimisation (SGD, Adam)
* Bias–variance trade‑off
* Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, ROC‑AUC)

## 2. Deep Learning & Computer Vision

**Why it matters**  Our reference implementation targets CIFAR‑10; you will likely use CNNs and modern optimisers. Knowing how they behave centrally will help you reason about federated convergence and accuracy drop‑offs.

**Topics to cover**

* Convolutional neural networks (LeNet, ResNet)
* Regularisation (dropout, weight decay, data augmentation)
* Learning‑rate schedules & early stopping

**Recommended resources**

## 3. Federated Learning Theory

**Why it matters**  This project orchestrates hundreds of decentralised clients. You need to understand FedAvg, client selection, straggler handling, and secure aggregation to design a robust coordinator.

**Topics to cover**

* FedAvg algorithm & convergence guarantees
* Client sampling strategies
* Secure aggregation protocols
* Handling unbalanced & non‑IID data

**Recommended resources**

| Type   | Resource                                                                                           |

## 4. Differential Privacy (DP)

**Why it matters**  We add noise to model updates so that training is provably privacy‑preserving.  Understanding ε, δ and the privacy accountant lets you pick sane budgets and justify them to stakeholders.

**Topics to cover**

* Formal DP definition (ε‑δ)
* Moments/Rényi accountants
* Gaussian & Laplace mechanisms
* User‑level vs record‑level DP

## 5. Distributed Systems & Networking

**Why it matters**  Your coordinator must talk to thousands of clients over the network, deal with retries, and aggregate gradients efficiently.  Concepts like back‑pressure and idempotent RPCs are essential.

**Topics to cover**

* gRPC (streaming, deadlines, retries)
* TLS basics (handshake, certificates)
* Load‑balancing & service discovery
* Fault tolerance, idempotency

**Recommended resources**

## 6. Containerisation & Orchestration

**Why it matters**  We ship the coordinator in a Docker image and run it on Kubernetes (EKS).  You need to know how to build minimal images, mount secrets, and write Helm charts that scale training jobs on demand.

* Writing efficient Dockerfiles (multi‑stage builds)
* Kubernetes primitives: Deployments, Jobs, CronJobs, Secrets, ConfigMaps
* Helm templating & chart structure
* Cluster autoscaling & spot instances

## 7. Cloud & MLOps

**Why it matters**  AWS gives us managed GPUs (SageMaker) and elastic control‑planes (EKS).  Good MLOps practice keeps experiments reproducible and costs under control.

**Topics to cover**

* SageMaker training jobs & endpoints
* EKS node groups & IAM/OIDC roles
* Infrastructure‑as‑Code with Terraform
* Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

**Recommended resources**

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Scan the table of contents** and mark the sections you’re weakest in.
2. **Allocate study blocks** (e.g., two weekends per major topic).
3. **Build small demos** after each section (e.g., run a TensorFlow Privacy example; write a Helm chart).
4. **Return to the project repo** and start wiring the pieces together.

Happy hacking!  When in doubt, open an issue or start a discussion—collaboration is at the heart of federated learning.
