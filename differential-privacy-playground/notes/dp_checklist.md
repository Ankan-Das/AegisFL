# DP Checklist (fill this per experiment/run)
- Neighboring relation: (user-level / record-level)
- Query/output: (what are we releasing?)
- Sensitivity: (Δ = ? and why?)
- Mechanism: (Laplace / Gaussian) with formula for noise scale
- Target budget: ε_total=?, δ=?
- Composition plan: (# of releases/rounds and how you spend ε)
- Post-processing: (what transformations happen after DP output)
- Accounting method (for later): RDP / moments accountant
- Acceptance criteria: (utility thresholds, e.g., accuracy drop ≤ X%)
