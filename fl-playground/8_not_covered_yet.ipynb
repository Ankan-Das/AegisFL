    "## What’s not covered (or only conceptually)\n",
    "\n",
    "These map directly to the “Practical Issues & Fixes” you flagged and a few production must‑haves.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non‑IID mitigation (beyond FedOpt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not implemented: FedProx (prox term μ), FedAvgM (server momentum), SCAFFOLD / control variates, FedNova, clustering or personalized FL (pFedMe, Per‑FedAvg, FedBN).\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Faster/more stable convergence on skewed clients; better per‑client accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stragglers & partial participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Not implemented: Async/near‑async aggregation, deadline‑based drop, staleness weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Keeps round time near median; realistic mobile conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Robust secure aggregation under dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing: Additive secret sharing / two‑server protocol to reconstruct masks if clients disappear; threshold‑t tolerant schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Makes secure‑agg usable in real rounds with churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Communication‑cost controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing: Gradient sparsification (Top‑k, Rand‑k), quantization (QSGD, 8‑bit/1‑bit), error‑feedback; payload/round accounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: 10–100× lower uplink without (much) accuracy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Privacy actually in the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Pending (next module): DP‑FedAvg integration (per‑client clipping + server Gaussian noise), RDP privacy accountant, user‑level ε tracking and early‑stop on budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Formal privacy guarantees; measurable ε–accuracy tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Security hardening beyond toy demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing in‑loop: mTLS for gRPC, replay protection (nonce/timestamps), auth tokens/attestation stubs, secret management (KMS), CI image scanning gating; poisoning defenses (clip‑and‑filter, cosine‑sim filters, median/trimmed‑mean/Krum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Realistic threat model coverage (honest‑but‑curious + malicious clients).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Fairness & per‑client quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing: q‑FFL or reweighting, long‑tail client metrics, per‑cohort evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Avoid models that serve only “majority” clients well.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Evaluation & ops gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing: Federated test evaluation (global vs per‑client), checkpointing & resume, Prometheus/Grafana wiring in these runs, experiment registry, deterministic seeds across all layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Reproducible science and debuggability.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Tuning & HParam search for FL\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing: Fed‑aware sweeps (server LR, client LR, C, E, μ for FedProx) with budgeted comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Systematic performance gains, not ad‑hoc wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested “next steps” checklist (actionable)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to round out the FL module before moving to DP/Sec:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement FedProx (μ grid: 0, 1e‑4, 1e‑3, 1e‑2) on the non‑IID Dirichlet(α=0.3) split; compare rounds‑to‑target vs FedAvg/FedAdam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add deadline‑based aggregation: sample C clients, give them random “latencies,” drop stragglers after a deadline; plot loss vs wall‑clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two‑server secure‑agg prototype: split masks across Aggregator & MaskServer; show exact‑sum even with 10–20% dropouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add comm‑compression: Top‑k (e.g., 1%/5%) with error‑feedback; log bytes/round and accuracy delta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust aggregator: median or trimmed‑mean on layer deltas; simulate 5–10% poisoned clients and show mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated test evaluation: extract server weights each 5 rounds, evaluate centrally; record IID vs non‑IID gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic fairness slice: track accuracy per label or per‑client size decile; report disparity."
